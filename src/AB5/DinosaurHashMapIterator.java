 * skips over any empty buckets and processes all non-empty buckets using the list iterator provided by each bucket.
 * If a bucket is completely processed, the {@code DinosaurHashMapIterator} continues to iterate seamlessly over the next
 * non-empty bucket. If all non-empty buckets have been processed {@code hasNext() returns false} and any subsequent call
 * to {@code next()} returns {@code null}</p>
