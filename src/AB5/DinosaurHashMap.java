 * (the bucket's index within the array) is determined by the dinosaur's DNA and the number of buckets.
 * It can be calculated as follows:<br>
 * {@code bucketIndex = ( absolute value of hash of dinosaur's DNA )  % ( number of buckets )}.</p>
 *
 * <p>To ensure performance efficiency, the {@code DinosaurHashMap} dynamically increases its number of buckets
 * if any bucket exceeds a specific size. The size of a bucket is defined as the number of elements within it.</p>
