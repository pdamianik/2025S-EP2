     * returning the final hand score.<br>
     * - The dealer loses (is busted) if his hand's score is greater than 21 and ends its play action by returning 0.<br>
     * <p>
     * If the dealer hand contains an ace, the ace is counted as 11 as long as the hand is not busted.

     * - the hand's score if the dealer hand is not busted and is not a Blackjack
     * - 0 if the dealer busted by cumulating a hand score over 21.
