/**
 * Class represents a full deck of 52 playing cards for the game of Blackjack.
 *
 * <p>A deck consists of 52 cards, which belong to one of 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades), each containing
 * 13 cards of distinct value. The card values include the numbers 2 to 10, as much as jack, queen, king and an ace.
 * A card's score is determined by its value. It is equivalent to its number if it is a number card, it is 10 (if the
 * card is a jack, a queen, or a king), and 1 or 11 if the card is an ace.</p>
 *
 * <p>A deck in addition keeps track of which cards have been drawn/used already. This information is reset if the deck
 * is shuffled.</p>
